# analysis_of_100k_medical_records_in_brazil

This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients
show up for their appointment. 

A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.  

‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment. 
‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital. 
‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família. 

The encoding of the last column: it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.  

As I go through the dataset and derive insights from it, I would like to find out the answers for all the below questions based on my 
analysis : - 

   1. Which gender is most likely to show up for their scheduled appointment? 
   2. Who has the more chance of appearing for the scheduled appointment ? one suffering from Hipertension or one suffering from Diabetes? 
   3. Who has the more chance of appearing for the scheduled appointment ? one suffering from Alcoholism or one who is a handcap?
